Assignment 1.10/2- Stephanie Engelhardt
The Basilisk Game (aka a cooler version of the snake game):

For this assignment, I made a snake game that is Harry Potter themed. The game comes with
a make file, and can be ran using "./main". The background of the story is that you are the
basilisk within the chamber of secrets, and you have to go around and "petrify" each of the
different muggle borns by walking over them. To control the basilisk, you can use the
arrow keys or k (for up), j (for down), h(for left), or l (for right). If you don't move
within 1/4 of a second, the basilisk will automatically start moving- it moves diagnolly
way in order to make it harder. If you run over the eggs following you or if you go out of
bounds (by going onto the tiles marked "X", you die. Whenever you die or if you win, there
is ASCII art displayed. In addition, there is ASCII art at the beginning of the game with an
option to go to the instructions page. When you pick up a new egg, the program picks from a
random list of muggle born names from Harry Potter and tells you who you petrified on the 
right hand side of the chamber. That message stays there until the next time you petrify
someone. I used our professors code for the io_queue messages (which is commented within the
code that I used it above the functions I used). I also have colors within the project 
(green to represent the basilisk and blue for the title 'chamber of secrets'). Within my 
code I use something similar as the dungeon type in previous assignments for the map within
this project and then I have classes for the eggs and the snake. The muggles are placed 
randomly throughout the chamber, as well as the basilisk's starting position.
